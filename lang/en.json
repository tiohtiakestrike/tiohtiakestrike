  "whoAreWe": "Who Are We?",
  "whoAreWePara1": "We are tenants, organizers, and community members in Tiohtià:ke (Montreal) who believe that housing is a human right, not a commodity. We come together from diverse backgrounds, united by our shared experience of rising rents, deteriorating housing conditions, and the erosion of our right to dignified shelter.",
  "whoAreWePara2": "Our movement is rooted in mutual aid, collective action, and the belief that real change comes from organized tenants standing together. We are building power from the ground up, block by block, building by building.",
  "whyRentStrike": "Why Rent Strike?",
  "whyRentStrikePara1": "A rent strike is a powerful tool for tenants to collectively withhold rent to demand better conditions, fair prices, and systemic change. When individual complaints fall on deaf ears, collective action creates undeniable pressure.",
  "whyRentStrikePara2": "In Tiohtià:ke, we face:",
  "whyRentStrikeList1": "Skyrocketing rents that far outpace wage increases",
  "whyRentStrikeList2": "Aggressive evictions through renovictions and demolitions",
  "whyRentStrikeList3": "Landlords who ignore maintenance and tenant rights",
  "whyRentStrikeList4": "A housing tribunal system that favors property owners",
  "whyRentStrikeList5": "The financialization of housing by corporate landlords and REITs",
  "whyRentStrikePara3": "By organizing a rent strike, we refuse to accept these conditions. We demand accountability, transparency, and a housing system that serves people, not profit. A rent strike is not just about withholding payment—it's about building tenant power and creating the leverage needed to win real victories.",
  "whyCoops": "Why Co-ops?",
  "whyCoopsPara1": "Housing co-operatives represent a fundamentally different model of housing: one based on collective ownership, democratic control, and long-term affordability. In a co-op, residents own and manage their homes together, removing the profit motive and ensuring that housing serves the community.",
  "whyCoopsPara2": "Co-ops offer:",
  "whyCoopsList1": "Permanently affordable housing protected from market speculation",
  "whyCoopsList2": "Democratic decision-making where residents control their living conditions",
  "whyCoopsList3": "Stable communities that can't be displaced by investors",
  "whyCoopsList4": "A proven model that has worked for decades across Quebec and around the world",
  "whyCoopsPara3": "We believe that housing co-operatives should be the dominant form of housing in our city. By converting rental buildings into co-ops, we can permanently remove housing from the speculative market and ensure that it serves the people who live in it. Our vision is a Tiohtià:ke where every resident has access to stable, affordable, community-controlled housing.",
