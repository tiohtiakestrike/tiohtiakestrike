  "coopsPara2": "Co-ops empower workers. By controlling our housing, we need to work less just to survive. Co-ops can build greenhouses and install solar panels. They can reserve space for shops whose profits provide free housing for those in need. By managing housing democratically, we could become fully autonomous, negotiate better wages, transform our workplaces into co-ops, and even standardize 2-3 day work weeks while enjoying better quality of life.",

  "whoWeArePara1": "The Tiohtià:ke Strike is a grassroots movement organizing strikes not to pressure authorities, but to free people's time and resources, thus empowering them. Our demands are addressed to people themselves.",
  "whoWeArePara2": "We trust people. We give everyone the power to organize and take initiative. Rather than a central team giving orders to volunteers, we rotate management tasks to demystify these skills. Real leaders inspire others to lead.",
  "whoWeArePara3": "A strike isn't the peak of class struggle—it's liberation itself. We believe it's our duty and more strategic to live as if we were already free. Rather than using our newfound time and energy to negotiate with authorities, we use them to build mutual aid networks and co-ops for a more autonomous life. The strike is a choreographed act of rest and healing.",
  "whoWeArePara4": "While we seek consensus, we don't impose it. A better world is one where differences have their place and can coexist without being stifled in the name of artificial unity. We encourage 'open disagreements openly arrived at.'",
